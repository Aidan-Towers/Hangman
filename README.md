CURRENTLY BROKEN

I"m somewhat familiar with C# and this was a little experiment to learn it a bit more. 
The problem with the code is that when it goes to load an image the file path will be incorrect since it was coded for my specific desktop. 
I want to go back and fix this at some point but I couldn't find a quick and simple solution and I wanted to work on other projects since I know everything else here works.
